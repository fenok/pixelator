# Pixelator: Per-pixel image editor

Pixelator is an image editor written for DCPU-16. Its core feature is per-pixel 
image creation and editing. It uses its own custom file format for pictures.

## How to run it

The program should work on DevCPU. The only file you need is 'Pixelator.3.0.txt'.

DevCPU: https://github.com/HerobrinesArmy/DevCPU

## How to use it

User manual is presented within the program and in the 'In-Program Docs.txt' file.

## Last words

It's a very old code that got abandoned when 0x10c was cancelled and I lost motivation. 
Surprisingly, someone is still messing with all that stuff, so I decided to share 
the code on GitHub and give it a license already. :D

More informative README is presented at the beginning of the 'Pixelator.3.0.txt' file.
