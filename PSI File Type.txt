1) magic_number
    The magic number is 0x5034. It defines the file's type as PSI.

2) file_name
    Defines the file's original name (independent from the File System).
Allowed characters: 0x20 - 0x7e (ASCII). The maximum length of the name is 15
characters, any unused characters at the end of the name must be set to null.
The minimum length of the name is 0 characters, which means that there is no
original name.

3) background_symbol
    Defines a symbol which is used as background for the image. It should be
null (but can be any symbol).

    Defines 127 symbols (2 words per symbol). These symbols are divided into 
USED and UNUSED.
    USED symbols have at least one location on the screen. USED symbols must be
unique. USED symbols must be not null.
    UNUSED symbols do not have any locations on the screen. UNUSED symbols must
be null.

5) image_palette
    Defines 16 colors. The first color should be contrast to the sixteenth.
In other words, the "black-by-default" color should be contrast to the
"white-by-default" one.

6) border_color
    Defines the number of border color. The number refers to image_palette.

7) video_ram
